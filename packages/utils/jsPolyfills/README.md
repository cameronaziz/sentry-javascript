### Javascript Polyfills

This is a collection of syntax polyfills either copied directly from or heavily inspired by those used by [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and [Sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase). When either tool uses one of these polyfills during a build, it injects the function source code into each file needing the function, which can lead to a great deal of duplication. For our builds, we have therefore implemented something similar to [`tsc`'s `importHelpers` behavior](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers): instead of leaving the polyfills injected in multiple places, we instead replace each injected function with an import statement. This is the location from which we import. For simplicity (and greater treeshaking ability when using tools which only work on a file-by-file level), each polyfill is in its own file.
