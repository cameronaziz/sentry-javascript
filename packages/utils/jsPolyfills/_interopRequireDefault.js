/**
 * Rollup and Sucrase have identical polyfills for `import { default as someName } from 'someModule'` and `import
 * someName from 'someModule'` syntax, named `_interopDefault` and `_interopRequireDefault`, respectively. For
 * simplicity, files with both names have been kept, so that we can replace each injected function with an import of the
 * same name.
 *
 * Sucrase only injects the polyfill when the `imports` transform is used, which we're not currently doing. By contrast,
 * Rollup injects its version when building cjs modules, which we do do. Therefore, the actual function definition lives
 * in `_interopDefault.js`, so that there's no indirection with the one we know we'll be using. Though we likely we
 * likely won't ever this the Sucrase version here, it seemed prudent to keep the stub just in case.
